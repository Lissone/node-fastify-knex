## Description

This project was developed with the goal of exploring and learning how to use the Fastify library for creating APIs with Node.js, as well as getting familiar with Knex as a query builder to interact with databases. I also took the opportunity to practice and solidify my knowledge in testing.

### Functional Requirements

- [x] The user must be able to create a new transaction;
- [x] The user must be able to get a summary of their account;
- [x] The user must be able to list all transactions that have occurred;
- [x] The user must be able to view a single transaction.

###  Business Rules

- [x] The transaction can be of the credit type, which will add to the total amount, or debit, which will subtract;
- [x] It must be possible to identify the user among the requests;
- [x] The user can only view transactions they have created.

### About Tests

- Unit: unit of your application;
- Integration: communication between two or more units;
- E2E: simulate a user operating in our application.

Test pyramid: E2E does not depend on any technology, nor on architecture.

## Requirements

- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
